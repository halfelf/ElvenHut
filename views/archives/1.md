Redcarpet is Ruby library for Markdown processing that smells like butterflies and popcorn.

Redcarpet used to be a drop-in replacement for Redcloth. This is no longer the case since version 2 -- it now has its own API, but retains the old name. Yes, that does mean that Redcarpet 2 is not backwards-compatible with the 1.X versions.

Redcarpet is powered by the Sundown library. You might want to find out more about Sundown to see what makes this Ruby library so awesome.

```ruby
markdown = Redcarpet::Markdown.new(Redcarpet::Render::HTML, :fenced_code_blocks => true)
markdown.render("This is *bongos*, indeed.")
```
